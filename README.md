# Quake4_Mod
Send in the next wave mod

This mod is a cod zombie style mod. Where you will have to survive waves of enemies and get points to buy weapons and perks. Run the game normally and skip through the openings till the menu pops up. If there is a white screen press escape to skip it!!!! To work the mod first select new game and select the difficultly then go into console and spawn in the monster teleport dropper with the command "spawn monster_teleport_dropper".This entity will then spawn in waves of enemies at a random rate and also ammo. It will also spawn itself to increase the wave rate of enemies.

The mod should have these deliverables done -monster spawning in waves in x amount of rounds -give me five custom monster features -change quake weapons to new theme -five different perks -a shop

The ones that are done are the five custom monster features, weapon changes, and waves.

To test the weapons deliverables in console type "give all" which will give you all the weapons. To test the monster features in consoe type "spawn monster_gunner" it will have a new weapon and a new grenade type and melee attack. Type in console "spawn monster_slimy_transfer" it only has a melee attack now instead of a vomit attack. Finally for the last monster feature type in console "spawn monster_teleport_dropper" it will spawn ammo and enemies for the player. You cannot kill it and it will not harm the player.
